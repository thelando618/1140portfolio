			<h1 class="intro">My name is <strong>Landon Zirkelbach</strong> and I am a <strong>Front-End Developer</strong> consistently looking for the next challenge.</h1>
			<p class="intro-text">I stay up to date on emerging techniques and look to implement each one as necessary into the project I work with. I specialize in <strong>HTML, 
				CSS, and jQuery</strong>. I have created websites from scratch but also worked with different frameworks and systems. Some technologies I have worked 
				with include <strong>Wordpress, Drupal, CodeIgniter, HTML5 Boilerplate, and Twitter Bootstrap</strong>. I have built mobile web sites, and even created 
				responsive web sites that adjust for which ever device you are using to view a site. This website was built to be responsive. 
				Try resizing the window to see it in action!
