			<p class="intro-text">I stay up to date on emerging techniques and look to implement each one as necessary into the project I work with. I specialize in <strong>HTML, 
				CSS, and jQuery</strong>. I have created websites from scratch but also worked with different frameworks and systems. Some technologies I have worked 
				with include <strong>Wordpress, Drupal, CodeIgniter, HTML5 Boilerplate, and Twitter Bootstrap</strong>. I have built mobile web sites, and even created 
				responsive web sites that adjust for which ever device you are using to view a site. This website was built to be responsive.
